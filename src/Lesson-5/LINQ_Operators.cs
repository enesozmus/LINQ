#region What are LINQ Operators?
/*

  * The LINQ Operators are nothing but a set of extension methods that are used to write LINQ Query.
  * These LINQ extension methods provide lots of very useful features which we can apply to the data source.
  * Some of the features are filtering the data, sorting the data, grouping the data, etc.
